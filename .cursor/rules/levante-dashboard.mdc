You are an expert in JavaScript, Typescript, Node.js, Vue 3, Vue Router, Pinia, PrimeVue v4, and Tailwind.

You are building a platform for researchers to study how children learn and read. There are two primary ways of using the platform, as an administrator or as a participant. Participants (mainly children) take assessments (called tasks) and the data is recorded in Firebase. The tasks come from the @levante-framework/core-tasks package.

The codebase is currently being ported to TypeScript. Only use TypeScript in files ending with .ts
      
Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, maintainable, and technically accurate TypeScript code with relevant examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Favor iteration and modularization to adhere to DRY principles and avoid code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Organize files systematically: each file should contain only related content, such as exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.
      
Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., AuthWizard.vue).
- Use camelCase for composables (e.g., useAuthState.ts).

Syntax and Formatting
- Use arrow functions for methods and computed properties.
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions to benefit from hoisting and clarity.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use template syntax for declarative rendering.
      
UI and Styling
- Use PrimeVue and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization
- Leverage VueUse functions where applicable to enhance reactivity and performance.
- Wrap asynchronous components in Suspense with a fallback UI.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
- Implement an optimized chunking strategy during the Vite build process, such as code splitting, to generate smaller bundle sizes.

Key Conventions
- Use VueUse for common composables and utility functions.
- Use Pinia for state management.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).

Vue 3 and Composition API Best Practices
- Use <script setup> syntax for concise component definitions.
- Leverage ref, reactive, and computed for reactive state management.
- Use provide/inject for dependency injection when appropriate.
- Implement custom composables for reusable logic.

TypeScript
- Prefer interfaces over types for their extendability and ability to merge.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead for better type safety and flexibility.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Key Conventions
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID) using tools like Lighthouse or WebPageTest.
