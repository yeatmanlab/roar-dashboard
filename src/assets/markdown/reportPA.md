# Phonological Awareness Score Report

**_ TBD I suggest putting SCHOOL NAME and Min to Max Date below the title_**

## Introduction to ROAR - Phonological Awareness

**_ROAR - Phonological Awareness_** measures **elision and sound matching** to assess a student's phonological awareness. Students need to achieve mastery of phonological awareness in order to achieve fluency in reading. Research shows that these foundational pre-reading skills are a barrier to learning for many students. Students not receiving support for their foundational readig skills may struggle to catch up in overall reading ability. This assessment is intended to help identify target skills for students who need extra support.

**This score report** provides information about the distribution of scores across each grade, the skills each student has mastered, and how each student's skills compare to the national norms for their age group.

**The assessment** provides a window into three specific phonological subskills where students may need support: first-sound matching, last-sound matching, and deletion. Students flagged as needing support in one of these subskills will likely benefit from direct instruction and practice with the flagged subskill and related phonological skills. The entire assessment takes most students 15-20 minutes.

## Overview

This score report presents information from the recent administration of the ROAR assessment to students in TBD_SCHOOL from TBD_DateMin to TBD_DateMax.

<div id="viz-distribution-by-grade-pa"></div>

- TBD students in grades TBD to TBD completed the ROAR Phonological Awareness task.
- The average age of the student was TBD.
- The average ROAR score was TBD (out of 57) (min = TBD, max = TBD , sd = TBD).

## Supporting students in developing phonological awareness

This assessment measures three skills related to phonological awareness: **First Sound Matching**, **Last Sound Matching**, and **Deletion**

<div id="viz-stacked-skill-by-grade-pa"></div>

We have classified students into the following categories:

- **Full Mastery**: Mastery demonstrated for all three skills.
- **Beginning to Exhibit Full Mastery**: Approaching mastery for all three skills.
- **Some Mastery**: Mastery demonstrated for one or two skills.
- **No Mastery**: Students who have not yet demonstrated mastery of any of these skills.

### About the Assessment

The following tasks are used to measure the students' skill level:

- **First Sound Matching:** A picture is shown, and the narrator says the word associated with the picture, e.g. _“bat.”_ Next, three more pictures are shown and narrated, e.g. _“car, ball, fox.”_ To answer correctly, the student clicks on the picture that shares the same first sound, e.g. _“ball.”_

- **Last Sound Matching:** A picture is shown, and the narrator says the word associated with the picture, e.g. _“mat.”_ Next, three more pictures are shown and narrated, e.g. _““mouse, hat, ball”_. To answer correctly, the student clicks on the picture that shares the same first sound, e.g. _“hat.”_

- **Deletion:** Three pictures are shown, and the narrator asks the student to choose the picture that corresponds to the word described by a deletion, e.g. _“What is rainbow without bow?”_ To answer correctly, the student would choose the picture of rain. In this test, the narrator does not narrate the answer pictures.

## Identifying Students who could Benefit from Support

The Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP) is a standardized test that was normed on a representative sample. By using the ROAR scores to estimate CTOPP scores, we show how each student's phonemic awareness skills relate to national norms.

The vertical cut scores represent thresholds for classifying students into three different support categories: _Average or Above Average_, _Some Support Needed_, or _Extra Support Needed_.

<div id="viz-normed-percentile-distribution-1-4-pa"></div>
**Kindergarten to 4th Grade**

- **Average or Above Average:** TBD students scored above the 50th percentile

- **Needs Some Support Needed:** TBD students scored between the 25th and 50th percentile.

- **Needs Extra Support Needed:** TBD students scored below the 25th percentile.

Growth in Phonological Processing is expected to plateau after mastery is reached. Thresholds for support classification are lower in the upper grades because the average student has already achieved mastery.

**5th to 8th Grade**

- **Average or Above Average:** TBD students scored above the 30th percentile

- **Some Support Needed:** TBD students scored between the 15th and 30th percentile.

- **Extra Support Needed:** TBD students scored below the 15th percentile.

### Distribution of Support Classifications by Grade

<div id="viz-stacked-support-by-grade-pa"></div>
According to these classifications:

- **Average or Above Average:** TBD students.

- **Some Support Needed:** TBD students.

- **Extra Support Needed:** TBD students.

### Notes on Interpreting this Score Report

- Results from this rapid screener should be interpreted in the context of other information you have about each student's reading ability. For example, a student who is not fully engaged during the assessment may receive a score that does not reflect their true ability.

- For English Language Learners, _ROAR Phonological Awareness_ scores should be considered along with knowledge about the student’s current level of English vocabulary. It can be more difficult for students to isolate sounds that are not present in their first language, and students may not know the English words needed to select the correct picture. English Language Learners who perform poorly should complete a phonological awareness assessment in their first language for additional insight.

- For a student needing support with decoding, use a student’s score on the _ROAR Phonological Awareness_ assessment to understand if the decoding issues stem from a need for intensive support in phonological awareness.

- This assessment provides a window into three specific phonological subskills where students may benefit from extra support. These skills may be addressed individually.

- If a student needs support in more than one of these domains, they likely need support in additional domains of phonological awareness, such as blending and segmenting. Students who are flagged by the ROAR as needing extra support may benefit from further evaluations for underlying difficulties with reading.

- If a student has fully mastered all of the tested domains, they likely have high phonological awareness in other domains as well.

- Ongoing research continues to refine thresholds for identifying students who may benefit from additional support. Defining these thresholds is part of our current research efforts. As part of this research collaborative, we invite your feedback about the information you see here.

### Teacher Resources for Reading Support

- The Florida Center for Reading Research offers free, online, age-specific, research-based lessons on phonological awareness and other foundational reading skills designed for pre-K through 5th-grade students [here](https://fcrr.org/student-center-activities/teacher-resource-guide).
